# Pong

## Recreating Pong using Java 

### I decide to use the Java Programming Language on Eclipse's IDE because of Java's native features like:

* import java.awt.Color;
* import java.awt.Graphics;
* import java.awt.Rectangle;
* import java.util.Random;

### and the main class was extended by Canvas, another native feauture of Java.
### This and another things makes easier to make graphics with Java than with anothers programming languages.
